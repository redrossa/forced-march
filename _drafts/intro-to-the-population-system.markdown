title: Intro to the Population System
---

Population control is one of the two major gameplay themes that characterize the game. The intricate population system is inspired by the impressive administration of governments during the classical antiquity, and I find it necessary to implement it this way. As the game focuses mainly on generals for playable characters, military leaders of the time were expected to also be political leaders.
