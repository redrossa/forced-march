My main inspiration to create Forced March came from learning about the cunning tactics Hannibal employed in his campaign in Italy. While his execution of the battles were perfect, they were less of a spontaneous event and more of a result of a series of cleverly chosen moves prior to the battles. My goal with Forced March is to capture the requirement for ingenious plays in a real-time wargame by offering customizations to a very precise level of detail.
