title: Intro to Warfare
---

My main inspiration to create Forced March came from learning about the cunning tactics Hannibal employed in his campaign in Italy. While his execution of the battles were perfect, they were less of a spontaneous event and more of a result of a series of cleverly chosen moves prior to the battles. My goal with Forced March is to capture the requirement for ingenious plays in a real-time wargame by offering customizations to a very precise level of detail. It may sound like the game is a micromanagement hell, but there are mechanics to prevent the game from falling into that abyss. I will first discuss all the gameplay features of warfare, and then I will discuss the checks to keep the game from becoming a chore.

- camera
- campaign
  - gathering
  - movement
  - line of sight
  - maintenance
  - communication
  - engineering
  - reinforcements
  - morale
  - autopilot
- battles
  - location
  - skirmishing
  - formation
  - line of sight
  - commandments
  - attacks
  - morale
  - autopilot

The same terrain map that is used in peacetime is used for the warfare gameplay. Also, there are no loading transitions between campaign expeditions and battles, which means the terrain map is fluidly used.
