title: Major Game Mechanics
---

Forced March is a real-time grand strategy wargame in which players take on the role of a character in classical antiquity. The map focuses on the Italian peninsula, set during the prelude to the First Samnite War.

As a role-playing game, the gameplay focuses on a character, who may belong to a state. During the start date, there may be more than one characters to choose from in the same state, usually the aristocrats as they are the ones with considerable political power. A game campaign ends when the player's character dies.

Forced March is largely a sandbox game, and it doesnâ€™t really define what a successful campaign is, rather, it's up to the player. The only degree of success that the game records is the degree of peace and security of the inheritance of the player's character, of which it is calculated based on the social conditions during the time of death.

Two major mechanics of the game are warfare and politics, the latter of which can be further divided into macro- and micro-. Warfare refers to when the player leads an army as a general throughout the map. While on a military campaign, the player must make sure their soldiers are well-fed, their army's morale in check, and to beware of their position, the enemy's position, and any skirmishers lurking in the vicinity.

Macropolitics refers to the player's involvement in the government of the state, which includes population management, interstate diplomacy, and civic obligations. Much of macropolitics are done through legislations and law enforcements. That means, laws must be formulated first and then passed, which then affects the population and the state's relations with other states. On top of that, each member of the government are expected to complete their assigned roles.

Micropolitics refers to the player's interaction with other characters. For example, there may be political parties in which a player must individually persuade other party members or get rid of. A player may also interact with other party members, characters from other states, or even non-aristocrats. Family management is also part of micropolitics. A player may conspire with other members of the extended family for control over the family head or feud over inheritance.

I will be working on the map system first as I think it's important that we have solid UI system planned out because the map will be the majority of the gameplay. I have started brainstorming on what I want the map system to be like as well as prototyping on some of the mechanics. I will be documenting what I currently have on my next post.
