title: Major Game Mechanics

Forced March is a real-time grand strategy wargame in which players take on the role of a character in classical antiquity. The map focuses on the Italian peninsula, set during the prelude to the First Samnite War.

As a role-playing game, the gameplay focuses on a character, who may belong to a state. During the start date, there may be more than one characters to choose from in the same state, usually the aristocrats as they are the ones with considerable political power. A game campaign ends when the player's character dies.

Forced March is largely a sandbox game, and it doesnâ€™t really define what a successful campaign is, rather, it's up to the player. The only degree of success that the game records is the degree of peace and security of the inheritance of the player's character, of which it is calculated based on the social conditions during the time of death.

Two major mechanics of the game are warfare and politics, the latter of which can be further divided into macro- and micro-. Warfare is played through when the player leads an army as a general throughout the map. While on a military campaign, the player must make sure their soldiers are well-fed, their army's morale in check, and to beware of their position, the enemy's position, and any skirmishers lurking in the vicinity.
