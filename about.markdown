My name is Reno Raksi, and I'm a student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I love history and video games. I mostly play strategy games series such as Civilizations and Total War but most importantly, Paradox Interactive games.

While I love to play video games, I thought the process of programming a video game unenjoyable. I found algorithmic and computational projects more rewarding (as you can see in my GitHub profile). That is until the ideas of Forced March occurred to me.

I was inspired to give life to the ideas of Forced March as a video game while I was binge watching historical battle videos by Kings and General and especially the Second Punic War series by History Marche on Youtube. The videos depict a birds eye view of a 2D map where small rectangular diagrams represent individual army units. While the battle were important, I learned that the marches throughout the countrysides were just as decisive. It's also impressive to see Hannibal's creativity as he marched throughout Italy, living off the land and crushing every army Rome sent. That's when I started imagining a game set on a large map where every movement counts and provided extreme customization in order to force players to get out of autopilot and use their creativity.

I created this site to serve as a platform for anyone to learn about the ideas of Forced March, perhaps form a team to join in my bandwagon, and just generally document the development. Suggestions are absolutely welcome if you can contact me via email. If you want to learn more about Forced March, news are published under Posts in the homepage. The Specs page details my expectation of the final product, which includes the gameplay as well as the mechanics that drive said gameplay.
