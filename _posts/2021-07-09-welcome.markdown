The first post is really just to enable the Post section to appear in the homepage. I will regularly be publishing more post about the development this same way. Expect posts to include non-major updates. For example I will be adding minor brainstorming ideas that I come up with that could be helpful to implement the game mechanics. I may also instead cancel ideas introduced earlier in later posts.

TL;DR Posts are essentially my notes.

P.S. Specs, on the other hand, will detail firm documentation about the mechanics that I have "prototyped" in Posts as well as those that I will for sure expect to include in the final product (mostly gameplay).
