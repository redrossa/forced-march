# Forced March Web

Welcome to the Github repo of the Forced March development blog.

I created this site to serve as a platform for anyone to learn about the ideas of Forced March, perhaps form a team to join in my bandwagon, and just generally document the development. I publish idea news under Posts in the homepage of the blog linked on this repo. You can comment on individual posts by creating an issue and linking the post file. Other inquiries please email them to me.
