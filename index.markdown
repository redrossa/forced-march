Take over the reins of the known world through cunning generalship or political intrigues. Forge your path as one of the great men of classical antiquity. Are you among the vanquished who disappeared in history? Or are you among the victors who wrote it?

## Introduction

Forced March is a real-time grand strategy wargame in which players take on the role of a character in classical antiquity. The map focuses on the Italian peninsula, set during the prelude to the First Samnite War.

## Main Features

Politics and warfare are the backbone of the game. Forced March features real-time untiled 2D map that occupies the majority of the gameplay with accurate line of sight, environment, and dynamic weather systems. AI-computed human population system dictates realistic societal attitudes. Sampled from the population system, individual characters come to life to give the player a more personal experience.
